MAIA MAILGUARD 1.0.3 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

As of Maia Mailguard 1.0.0, documentation is being maintained
centrally on the Maia Mailguard website <http://www.maiamailguard.com>,
and is not being bundled with the distribution itself.  This reflects
the fact that documentation evolves and gets refined at a different
rate than the code itself, so rather than issue new releases when a
change has been made to the documentation, it makes more sense to
direct users to the official website to find the most current
documentation available at the time.

Detailed installation instructions for Maia Mailguard 1.0.3 can be
found at <http://www.maiamailguard.com/maia/wiki/Install>.

Instructions for upgrading to Maia Mailguard 1.0.3 from earlier
versions can be found at <http://www.maiamailguard.com/maia/wiki/Upgrade>.

RELEASE NOTES:

Perl 5.10 compatibility: Please update your amavisd.conf virus scanner 
config to include a /m on regular expressions. As noted in more recent 
amavisd-new distributions:

"NOTE: When upgrading Perl to version 5.10 or planning to do so, please do
not forget to add a missing /m flag to regular expressions in your existing
AV entries ... Perl 5.8 does not mind missing /m flags, but with perl 5.10
the results from a virus scanner may no longer be properly recognized."

The sample config file provided has been modified accordingly.
